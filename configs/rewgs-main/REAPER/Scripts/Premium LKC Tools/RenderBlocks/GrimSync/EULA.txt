		DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH IT.

		IF YOU RELEASE A SCRIPT USING MY LIBRARY I'D LOVE TO KNOW ABOUT IT,
		AND WOULD BE THRILLED TO SEE MY NAME MENTIONED ON YOUR SCRIPT'S THREAD/WEBSITE.
		IF YOU PLAN TO CHARGE MONEY FOR A SCRIPT USING THIS LIBRARY, THAT'S GREAT, 
		BUT I'D REALLY APPRECIATE A DONATION FOR MY TIME AND EFFORT.
		IF YOU JUST USE OR COPY MY CODE WITHOUT MENTIONING WHERE IT CAME FROM,
		I'LL BE VERY UPSET AND MIGHT BECOME AN ALCOHOLIC TO COPE WITH THE EMBARASSMENT.
		AND THEN MY MARRIAGE WOULD FALL APART, AND MY FAMILY WOULD ABANDON ME.
		AND I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO HOLD DOWN A JOB,
		SO I'D BE HOMELESS AND SICK AND IT WOULD BE ALL YOUR FAULT.
		YOU BASTARD.

			  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
			  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

			  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
			  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
			  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
			  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
			  as modifying the License.

		  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		  may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		  for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		  for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		  reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

		  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		  the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		  and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		  or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		  License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		  on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		  of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		  of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
