 Installation of resources files for OSX:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Extract the Scripts and Data folders inside this zip to your REAPER resources folder. 
  If you are not sure how to find the Resources folder, the best way is to run the command 
  from REAPER. It's in the Options menu "Show REAPER resource path in explorer/finder..."
 
* The script is now in the following subdirectory: 
  "*REAPER_resources_path*/Scripts/HeDaScripts/HeDaScripts Manager"

* Download unar (this utility is used to install the downloaded packages)
  Download from http://unarchiver.c3.cx/commandline
  command line utility and copy "unar" file to the "_resources" folder inside the script folder:
  "*REAPER_resources_path*/Scripts/HeDaScripts/HeDaScripts Manager/_resources/unar"
	
* In REAPER, load the script:
  Go to Actions, Show Actions list...  and click "Load" and select the file "HeDaScripts Manager.lua" 
  Now you can run the action and the HeDaScripts Manager window appears and downloads the list of 
  scripts available to install/upgrade. 

* There is an included icon "HeDa_HSM.png" if you want to make a toolbar button in REAPER.
