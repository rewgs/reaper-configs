  Loudness Graph - Installation instructions
---------------------------------------------------

Requirements

    - REAPER 5.16 or above http://www.reaper.fm/download.php
      This script is built for REAPER 5 and above only.
    - SWS Extensions 2.7.1 or more recent. http://sws-extension.org/
    - TBProAudio / dpMeterII 1.1.8 or above http://www.tb-software.com/TBProAudio/dpmeter2.html
      Why is dpMeter needed? This script uses the dpMeter plugin made by TBProAudio for the Loudness analysis. 
	  It gets the number values from it and represents the meters and graph.
	- Powerful CPU: It is a CPU hungry script if you add many tracks to analyze. If you see some glitches in 
	  the graph it may be because the CPU is not powerful enough to draw the graph in realtime.

Installation

    Install the VST3 version of dpMeterII
    If you install both VST2 and VST3 versions, you will have to rename the VST2 version in REAPER with a suffix, 
	so it is better to install only the VST3 version.
    
	Extract THE FOLDER inside the zip, with all the files, to the REAPER resources path.
	Or in the portable folder if running a portable installation. The path of the script should look like:
    C:\Users\(UserX)\AppData\Roaming\REAPER\Scripts\HeDaScripts\Loudness Graph VIP\HeDa_Loudness Graph VIP.lua
	or like this for a portable installation (example):
	C:\REAPER\Scripts\HeDaScripts\Loudness Graph VIP\HeDa_Loudness Graph VIP.lua
	
	Then add the script to REAPER as any script in the actions window. Click "Load", and select the lua file.
    Then the action is added and you can create a toolbar button or assign it a keyboard shortcut.

Terminating the script:

    If you run the script again while it is running, a prompt will be presented to terminate the script.
    You should click to remember the setting and click Terminate to close it.
