  HeDa Regions & Markers from Items - Instructions     
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 There are two versions of the script. One that runs in the background constantly
 and one that opens a window where you can select which tracks to activate
 
 Label the tracks containing your items with a suffix "Markers x" or "Regions x"
 Where x is a number that will be used as the start id number for the markers.
 You can have several tracks, with different starting numbers to avoid markers to have the same id.
 You should avoid different tracks with same id markers.
 For example you could have these tracks, with 100 items in each.
 - EXPORT Regions 1
 - Structure Regions 100
 - Lyrics Regions 200
 - Annotations 300
 If you add/remove tracks while the script is running you should close and restart 
 the script to refresh the list of tracks
 
 Add some items, or empty items in the track.
 The notes of the item will be used for the region or marker name.
 Region or Marker color will be inherited from the item's color.
 If you have SWS extensions with auto coloring regions or markers you should revise the settings below
 
 When the script is running it will update the regions and markers, from the items in 
 each track that is not muted. Mute the track and it will delete the markers. 
 We have to delete them since we can't hide them. But if you want them back, 
 just unmute the track. So it's like Show/Hide.
