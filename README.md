This repo contains various Reaper configs, located in the [`configs`](./configs/) directory. They follow the following directory structure:

```bash
.
├── README.md
└── configs
    └── config-name
        ├── README.md
        └── REAPER
```

Any given config can be made active by symlinking its `REAPER` directory to the appropriate location, depending on your OS. If you'd like, you can use my [`ReaConfig`](https://github.com/rewgs/reaconfig) tool to help you do just that (in addition to all sorts of other tasks related to Reaper config management).
